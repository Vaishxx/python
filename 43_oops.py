CLASSES-a blueprint for creating objects that share common attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods). It serves as a template or a structure that defines the properties and functionalities an object of that class will possess.
Classes in Python provide a way to organize and structure code, promote code reusability, and enable the creation of objects with defined behaviors and attributes. They form a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) and are widely used in Python development.
syntax:
  class Class_name:
       methods and variables

OBJECT-an instance of class.when is defined,a template(info)is defined.memory is allocated only after object instantiation.
-object of a given class can invoke the method available to it without revealing the implementation details to user--->abstraction and encapsulation     

modelling in OOPS
# name-->class-->employee
# abjective-->attributes-->name,age,salary
# verb-->methods-->getSalary(),increment()

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i==5:
        break  #break is used to exitv from the loop.
else:
    print("this is inside else of for")    
#here else statement will only work when the for loop is successfully executed.(mtlb agr sari iterartion hone ke bd exit hua h to else work krega aur agr break statement ki wjh se exit hua h loop to else work nhi work krega)

# similarly there is while else statement
